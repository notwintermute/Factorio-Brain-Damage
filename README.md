Have you played Factorio and wondered what it would look like if your engineer had a TBI? What about getting head injuries? Then this is the mod for you!  
Includes options for:  
- Forgetting once a certain number of minutes have passed.
- An adjustable chance to forget every time you get damaged.
- Forgetting not just a technology but it's direct prerequsites too.

Note that if you forget a technology then neither you or your machines can produce that item. It will not delete any items nor will it remove science packs.  
For example, forgetting Advanced Circuits means you can not make any advanced circuits until you re-research the technology.
